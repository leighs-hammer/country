# rural
Currently under development, a country helper for js apps neededin to normalize or use a standard base to get, ISO codes, currencies, capitals and potentially more localised data such as states etc. 

Why? As these are effectively JSON data sets, the return is fast and with out network latency of look up services external to the project. 
I am building this a normalization library cadidate. 

## Api
undefined at present. 

Candidate:

`rural(CODE,OUTPUT)`

Returns the data requested in the output params.
